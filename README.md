# Basic Webapp Generator #

There are many web app seeds using different techniques. This is just one of them I created with a set up that I quite like.

## This webapp generator uses: ##
* Gulp (as task manager)
* less coding & minify of your stylesheets
* Live-Reload (Chrome Plugin needs to be installed and enabled)
* uglify and concatenation of your javascripts

## Installation: ##
Clone repository from git@github.com:alexoconner/basic-webapp.git
```
git clone git@github.com:alexoconner/basic-webapp.git .
```

And install node modules
```
npm install
```

## Usage / Gulp Tasks ##
* gulp
* gulp build
* gulp watch

Built code is to be found in `/dist`
